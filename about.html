            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                At <strong>Creative Concepts</strong>, we’ve been proudly serving our community for 30+ years. 
                What began as a small family-owned painting crew has grown into a full-service contracting business offering 
                painting, concrete, and electrical work for both residential and commercial clients. Over the years, we’ve built 
                a reputation for reliability, professionalism, and high-quality craftsmanship. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We understand that inviting a contractor into your home or business requires trust. That’s why we treat every 
                project as if it were our own property — respecting your time, your space, and your investment. From the very 
                first consultation to the finishing touches, we work closely with our clients to ensure that the end result not 
                only meets but exceeds expectations. Our story is one of growth, dedication, and a passion for transforming 
                ordinary spaces into something extraordinary.

        <!-- Our Mission -->
        <div class="about-block">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Our mission is simple but powerful: to provide exceptional contracting services that bring lasting value to our 
                clients. We believe that a freshly painted room can completely change the way you feel in a space, that properly 
                poured concrete can transform the look and function of a yard, and that safe, reliable electrical work can give 
                you peace of mind. Every service we provide is rooted in our belief that quality and integrity should always come 
                first.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond just the technical work, our mission is to create positive experiences. That means showing up on time, 
                communicating clearly, offering fair and transparent pricing, and leaving every project site cleaner than we 
                found it. We want our customers to feel confident choosing us again and again, knowing they are working with a 
                team that genuinely cares about their satisfaction and the long-term success of their projects.
